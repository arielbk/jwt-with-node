This is just me playing around with JWT in Node, and trying to wrap my head around it.

## Resources
Some useful links for JWT in Node:
- [JWT auth for Node SPAs](https://medium.com/dev-bits/a-guide-for-adding-jwt-token-based-authentication-to-your-single-page-nodejs-applications-c403f7cf04f4)
- [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/)
